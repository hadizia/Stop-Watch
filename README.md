# Stop-Watch
Designed the stopwatch using a 7 segment decoder, a clock divider and a counter circuit A multi-mode counter was used to hold the state imported by the push buttons on the DE1-SoC board Made a final report on the stopwatch which included the summary of the resource utilization as well as RTL schematics

This was done with the help of a friend: Mustafain Ali Khan
